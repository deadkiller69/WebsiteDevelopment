   <h4> 1.	What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h4>
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML, that follows a traditional client-server model and was developed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but may also be used for other applications.
 
<h4>
2.	Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?
</h4>
HTTP is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. Thus, the server does not store data between two requests.  
 <h4>
3.	Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP.
</h4>
The three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols are: 
<ol>
    <li>
	The client establishes a TCP connection. 
</li>
<li>
The client sends a request and waits for the answer.
</li>
<li>
    The server processes the request by sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>
4.	Describe the parameters on a get and post request.
</h4>
GET method is used to request data from specified resource. <br>
POST method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. <br>
The major distinction is that the GET method sends the request in the URL, whereas the POST method sends the data in the body part. <br>
<h4>
5.	What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes 200, and 404 indicate?
</h4>
HTTP response status codes shows whether or not a particular HTTP request was completed successfully.  <br>
200 indicates that the request has succeeded and 404 indicates file not found.
<h4>
6.	What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.
</h4>
An HTTP cookie is a tiny piece of data sent by a server to a user's web browser. For example: it remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
<h4>
7.	Why are cookies a security issue?
</h4>
Information is saved in cookies that is accessible to the user. If you're not careful, that information might be stolen by another user via third-party software. 
<h4>
8.	Describe session hijacking and XSS?
</h4>
Session hijacking is an attack in which the attacker takes control of a user's session without the user's knowledge, obtains the session ID, and uses it to impersonate someone else. 
XSS is a type of injection security attack in which an attacker injects data, such as a malicious script, into content from trusted websites.
<h4>
9.	Describe Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?
</h4>
Cross-site request forgery (commonly known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick users into doing things they don't want to do.
<h4>
10.	What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?
</h4>
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is an HTTP header-based method that allows a server to specify any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) from which a browser should permit resources loading.
The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers.
