                KATHMANDU: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he does not think the Covid 19 virus has been leaked from a Chinese lab. The Prime Minister 
                of the United Kingdom Johnson made the remarks while addressing a press conference of the Group of Seven (G-7). 
                "Initially, it was rumored that a corona virus had leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, but now it doesn't look like it," Johnson told a news conference. 
                A report in late December 2019 stated that the virus had been released from the lab. In particular, then-US President Donald Trump made baseless 
                allegations that he may have been prepared in a Chinese laboratory.

            <p>
                But a few days ago, a report published in the American media said that the staff of a laboratory in Wuhan had fallen ill. A report published in
                the Wall Street Journal , citing a report by the US intelligence agency , claimed that staff at a laboratory in Wuhan had fallen ill before being found infected 
                with the corona virus. However, the report has not been independently confirmed.

            <br>
            <p>
                But China has said the US has made baseless allegations. The World Health Organization had also visited China and conducted research on the 
                subject. In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report after a site visit and investigation in Wuhan , dismissing allegations that the origin of 
                the corona virus had been prepared in a laboratory. A preliminary report by the WHO on the origin of the corona virus states that the corona virus is transmitted 
                from animals to humans. Preliminary studies have shown that Chamero and Salak may have transmitted the corona.

            <br>
            <p>
                The WHO report suggests that farm corals may be a major source of coronavirus transmission. However, the study did not reveal which animal was infected with the 
                corona virus. The report states that the corona virus may have been transmitted from Chamero to an animal and then to humans.
